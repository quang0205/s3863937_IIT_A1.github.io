                                    GitHub is a service that provides a web-based Git source code repository for software development projects. 
                                    GitHub offers both a paid version and a free version for accounts. 
                                    Open source projects will be provided with a free repository.
                                </p>
                                    <ol type="i">
                                        <li>GitHub.com</li>
                                        <p>
                                        Projects on GitHub.com can be accessed and managed using the standard Git command-line interface;
                                        all standard Git commands work with it. GitHub.com also allows users to browse public repositories on the site.
                                        Many desktop clients and Git plugins are also available. The site provides social media-like functions such as feed, follower, wiki (using wiki software called Gollum)
                                        and a social media graph to show how developers work on their versions ("branches") of a repository and which branches (and branches within that branch) are up-to-date.
                                        </p>

                                            GitHub is mainly used for hosting software source code, 
                                            but is also commonly used with many file types such as Final Cut or Word documents.

                            <p><strong> What is Git? </strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    Git is the name of a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
                                    which is one of the most popular distributed version management systems today.
                                </p>
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>Advantages of Git</li>
                                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                                    <li>Free and open source</li>
                                    <p>
                                        Git is released under the GPL's open source license. It is available for free on the net. 
                                        You can use Git to manage niche projects without paying a penny. 
                                        As an open source, you can download its source code and also make changes according to your requirements.
                                    </p>
                                    <li>Fast speed and compact</li>
                                    <p>
                                        When most of the operations are done internally, it gives a huge benefit in speed. 
                                        Git is not server dependent, that is the reason why there is no need to interact with the remote server (git server) for every operation.
                                    </p>
                                    <li>Backup offline</li>
                                    <p>
                                        It is rare to lose data when there are many copies of it. 
                                        The data is present to any client, so it can be used in the event of a failure or a server shutdown.
                                    </p>
                                    <li>High safety</li>
                                    <p>
                                        Cannot change file, date and commit message and any other data from Git database without knowing Git.
                                    </p>
                                    <li>Does not require a strong hardware</li>
                                    <p>
                                        Developers do not interact with the server unless they need to publish changes. 
                                        All of this happens on the client side, so the server hardware can be really a simple matter.
                                    </p>
                                    <li>Branching is easier</li>
                                    <p>
                                        Branch management with Git is very simple. It only takes a few seconds to create, delete, and import branches.
                                    </p>
                                </ul>
